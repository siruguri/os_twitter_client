# Notes

* Use the notification log mechanism to track what's up with a word cloud update
* Need to see if doc word stats are being processed from mongo  - probably not, a test in twitters_controller_test is failing
* Refresh = for everyone who has tweeted in the last 3 months, get their newest tweet and get everything since then.
